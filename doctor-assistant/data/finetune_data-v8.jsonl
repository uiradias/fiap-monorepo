Specifically, maternal race--being African American--was indirectly associated with overall charges through its association with mode of delivery and NICU utilization patterns. The presence of maternal co-morbidities--Herpes Simplex Virus, hypertension and diabetes--most probably influenced babies' hospital stay charges as well as NICU charges when transferred to NICU following both vaginal and Cesarean section deliveries. Thus, prenatal care targeting co-morbidities management may reduce the odds of a newborn's transfer to NICU thus avoiding greater lengths of stay, medical care and charges.

It is more appropriate to use robust estimators such as the least trimmed mean squares estimator to estimate the scale parameter gamma under such circumstances. Moreover, we show by simulation studies that the scale-free property is robust to some error mechanisms but untenable to others. The simulation results also suggest that different error mechanisms may be operating in the yeast protein interaction networks produced from different data sources. In the MIPS gold standard protein interaction data, there appears to be a high rate of false negative links, and the false negative and false positive rates are more or less constant across proteins with different connectivities. However, the error mechanism of yeast two-hybrid data may be very different, where the overall false negative rate is low and the false negative rates tend to be higher for links involving proteins with more interacting partners."}]}

Nevertheless a fulminant infection often developed in diabetic ulcers despite the initial inability to demonstrate bacterial growth. In order to start antibiotic treatment as early as possible, a wound smear should be obtained routinely from patients with diabetic ulcers. In chronic venous ulcers, a routine swab does not appear to be indicated as it bears no clinical consequences. The same applies to patients with surgically fully treated peripheral arterial occlusive disease. As ischemia presents the limiting factor, antibiotic therapy in case of infection will not prevent imminent amputation."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does long-term cultivation of saplings under elevated CO2 concentration influence their photosynthetic response to temperature?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Elevated CO2 instantaneously increases temperature optima of Amax due to reduced photorespiration and limitation of photosynthesis by RuBP regeneration. However, this increase disappears when plants are exposed to identical CO2 concentrations. In addition, increased heat-stress tolerance of primary photochemistry in plants grown at elevated CO2 is unlikely. The hypothesis that long-term cultivation at elevated CO2 leads to acclimation of photosynthesis to higher temperatures is therefore rejected. Nevertheless, incorporating acclimation mechanisms into models simulating carbon flux between the atmosphere and vegetation is necessary."}]}

Further, the conduct of additional recruitment recontacts was an inefficient means for increasing statistical power. For the conduct of physician surveys, a practice that may in some cases be cost-effective, while also controlling total survey error, is to establish a larger initial sample; to either eliminate nonresponse follow-up or to limit this to one recontact; and to accept a somewhat lower final overall survey response rate."}]}

These tasks require expertise that is unlikely to exist in each locality. The CQUIN framework potentially offered an opportunity to learn how technical design influenced outcome but due to the high degree of local experimentation and little systematic collection of key variables, it is difficult to derive lessons from this unstructured experiment about the impact and importance of different technical design factors on the effectiveness of pay-for-performance. Balancing the policy goal of localism with the objective of improving patient outcomes leads us to conclude that a somewhat firmer national framework would be preferable to a fully locally designed framework."}]}

Many of these findings are consistent with a stress process model, in which stress from caregiving can directly or indirectly affect a variety of measures of health, although some of the findings (asthma and arthritis) seem to strain this hypothesis. Alternate interpretations of these findings include the possibility that parents who are in regular contact with the health care system may have more opportunities to discuss and receive attention for their own health concerns than do comparison adults or that the greater number of health issues reported by CGs is related to the nature of our study, perhaps leading these parents to focus on their health and well-being in more depth than is usually feasible in a population survey. CGs of children with CP also had lower incomes, despite the absence of any important differences in education. The findings are consistent with the idea that the financial burden of caring for a child with a disability results in part from a reduced availability of these parents to work for pay."}]}

If the anterior chamber pressure temporarily lowers the level of the venous capillary pressure, it is consistent with a patent piping system when a reverse flow with blood reflux into the anterior chamber can be observed as long as a minimal physiological pressure gradient from the anterior chamber in the direction of channel Schlemm's canal has been restored.

Under-representation of low SES groups could underestimate the reported effect of an intervention for those with a higher baseline risk. The marginal benefit identified in a trial with poor or no representation of lower SES participants could significantly underestimate the potential benefit to a low SES community.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the carbonyl group is an essential structural requirement for transport by the small-peptide carrier. In contrast, the interaction with the small-peptide carrier is still present, shown by the inhibition of the fluxes of amoxycillin. Reduction of the peptide bond of enalapril resulted in a new substrate for the P-glycoprotein efflux pump."}]}

This investigation highlights several challenges related to the prevention and control of varicella outbreaks with the 1-dose varicella vaccination program and the need for further prevention of varicella through improved vaccine-induced immunity with a routine 2-dose vaccination program. The challenges include: 1-dose varicella vaccination not providing sufficient herd immunity levels to prevent outbreaks in school settings where exposure can be intense, the effective transmission of varicella among vaccinated children, and the difficulty in the diagnosis of mild cases in vaccinated persons and early recognition of outbreaks for implementing control measures. The efficacy of 2 doses of varicella vaccine compared with 1 dose was assessed in a trial conducted among healthy children who were followed for 10 years. The efficacy for 2 doses was significantly higher than for 1 dose of varicella vaccine. This higher efficacy translated into a 3.3-fold lower risk of developing varicella>42 days after vaccination in 2- vs 1-dose recipients. Of the children receiving 2 doses, 99% achieved a glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay level of>or =5 units (considered a correlate of protection) 6 weeks after vaccination compared with 86% of children who received 1 dose. The 6-week glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay level of>or =5 units has been shown to be a good surrogate for protection from natural disease. Ten years after the implementation of the varicella vaccination program, disease incidence has declined dramatically, and vaccination coverage has increased greatly. However, varicella outbreaks continue to occur among vaccinated persons. Although varicella disease among vaccinated persons is mild, they are contagious and able to sustain transmission. As a step toward better control of varicella outbreaks and to reduce the impact on schools and public health officials, in June 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the use of a second dose of varicella vaccine in outbreak settings. Early recognition of outbreaks is important to effectively implement a 2-dose vaccination response and to prevent more cases. Although the current recommendation of providing a second dose of varicella vaccine during an outbreak offers a tool for controlling outbreaks, a routine 2-dose recommendation would be more effective at preventing cases. Based on published data on immunogenicity and efficacy of 2 doses of varicella vaccine, routine 2-dose vaccination will provide improved protection against disease and further reduce morbidity and mortality from varicella."}]}

This is line with recent studies suggesting that some SGA carried a higher average risk of electroencephalographic abnormalities than many FGA. Nonetheless, It is well known that spontaneous reports do not allow strong inferences about adverse drug effects, because differences in reporting fractions by time, drug or type of event are difficult or even impossible to distinguish from differences in the occurrence rates of adverse events. Still, we consider that the possibility of SGA carrying a higher risk of seizure induction than FGA warrants further research."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Should people who have joint symptoms, but no diagnosis of arthritis from a doctor, be included in surveillance efforts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Only 6.3% of those classified as having possible arthritis had what we considered to be arthritis. Most who did not see a doctor reported mild symptoms and, therefore, would be unlikely to be amenable to medical and public health interventions for arthritis. Although including possible arthritis would slightly improve the sensitivity of detecting arthritis in the population, it would increase false-positives that would interfere with targeting state intervention efforts and burden estimates. The ability to add back questions to the BRFSS survey allows for the reintroduction of possible arthritis in case national surveillance indicates it necessary or if studies document an increased rate at which possible arthritis turns into arthritis. Currently, possible arthritis does not need to be included in state arthritis surveillance efforts, and limited question space on surveys is better spent on other arthritis issues."}]}

As for FMEA's methodology for scoring failures, there were discrepancies between the teams' estimates and similar incidents reported on the trust's incident database. Furthermore, the concept of multiplying ordinal scales to prioritise failures is mathematically flawed. Until FMEA's validity is further explored, healthcare organisations should not solely depend on their FMEA results to prioritise patient safety issues."}]}

This limitation means mortality rates in the NZCMS are increasingly underestimated with time since census night, particularly for Pacific and Asian people. However, previously published NZCMS trends remain valid as the duration of follow-up (3 years) is short, and cohorts were not split by time since census. Nevertheless, it is safe to conclude that mortality rates continued to decline from 2001-03 to 2003-04 for all four ethnic groups.

Developmental delay/mental retardation, however, did not appear to increase the risk of maltreatment, while chronic physical health conditions increased the risk slightly among this group of children. Therefore, identified behavior/mental health in young, low-income children should be considered a risk factor for potential abuse to pediatricians and other health professionals. Child protection agencies should be trained to identify behavioral/mental health conditions of children."}]}

Additionally, those responsible for health-related planning could benefit from the knowledge of how their state ranks in comparison to others vis-\u00e0-vis the consumption of fruits and vegetables by rural adults---a population increasingly being identified as one at risk for health disparities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can reversibility of nasal obstruction predict the grade of bronchial hyperreactivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The study points out to narrow relationship between bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis, where patients with negative decongestion test showed significantly increased grade of bronchial hyperreactivity. Due to this patients with insufficient response of nasal mucosa to decongestive agent probably require more intensive antiinflammatory therapy compared to patients with positive response. Nasal decongestion tests can be used for examination of the effect of allergic inflammation of nasal mucosa on the lower airways and vice versa (Tab. 4, Ref. 27)."}]}
