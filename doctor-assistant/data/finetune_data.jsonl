Summed raw scores below 18 will be unaffected if nondrivers either score as zero or simply omit item 8. The scale is therefore robust for detecting cases of pathological sleepiness in stroke but may not be suitable for measuring high levels of sleepiness in a sample containing both drivers and nondrivers.
